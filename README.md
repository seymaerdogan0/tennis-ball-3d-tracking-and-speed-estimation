# tennis-ball-3d-tracking-and-speed-estimation
A Python research project for reconstructing the 3D trajectory and speed of a tennis ball using multi-camera data. The system applies DLT triangulation with calibrated cameras, performs speed and bounce analysis, and validates results through reprojection error metrics and gravity acceleration estimation.
